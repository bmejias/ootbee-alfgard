== Alfresco health checker guardian

This project started during the Alfresco Global Hackathon of the 23rd of
September, 2016.

=== Description

We want to build a daemon that is constantly monitoring certain values than can
help us to identify potential risks (unhealthy status). When values reach
predefined thresholds, the daemon takes action. Things we want to monitor are
the following:

- Database connection pool size (and status of connections)

- Tomcat thread pool size 

- Status of libreoffice converter (is it running? listening?)

- Amount of connected users

*Practical info*: I'm writing the daemon in Python and it will run on Linux. I
can retrieve some data from Alfresco through the jmx-rmi connector, but this
works only for Enterprise Edition. I need help to retrieve that information in
Community Edition, hopefully in the form of webscripts.
